# Exploratory Data Analysis-Coursera

This course featured two projects. My projects can be viewed in the the folders "Course_Project_1" and "Course_Project_2." 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Course Description:

This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. We cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics. We also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.

### Course Content:

- Making exploratory graphs
- Principles of analytic graphics
- Plotting systems and graphics devices in R
- The base, lattice, and ggplot2 plotting systems in R
- Clustering methods
- Dimension reduction techniques

### The Course Projects

The two course projects will be assessed via peer assessment. In these projects, you will be asked to construct or reproduce certain plots, the purpose of which is to make you familiar with various plotting options. You will be evaluated on the plot that you produce and the code that you write to construct the plot. Course projects evaluated via peer assessment will make use of your GitHub account.
